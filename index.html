			<h2>The Man, The Myth.</h2>
			<p>Hi! My name is Eugene Lim, and I'm an aspiring game developer currently studying at
			Nanyang Polytechnic's Game Development and Technology Course, in hopes of either working for a studio one day,
			or learning enough to get started on my own big projects.</p>
			<p>I really love playing video games and learning how they work.
			Some of my recent favourites outside of the FPS genre (which will always hold a place in my heart,)
			include Turn-Based and Fighting Video Games.</p>
			<p>You can scroll down to see what I'm working on, or go to the other pages to learn more about me.</p>

			<h2>The Legend, a Project.</h2>
			<p>I'm looking to learn Unity more deeply so that I can work on a game I'm calling Criminal Courier,
			where you play as a courier who delivers packages to criminals while navigating a bustling city,
			and spending your free-time to either upgrade your business or for recreational activities like talking to friends!</p>
			<p>Hopefully I can share more details soon, when I start development, create a gameplay prototype, and release it on Itch.io!</p>

			<h2>The Other.</h2>
			<p>I have a creative writing project I hope can be turned into a Table-Top RPG at some point, and it is currently the setting
			for an existing D&D Game me and some friends are playing in.</p>
			<p>The premise is that the world was hit by a destructive comet that
			changed the planet's landscape, gifted people with newfound powers, created a new resource in the form of
			crystals varying in rarity and power, alongside introducing the world to uniquely horrifying monsters and the difficulty of the new world.</p>
			<p>I'm hoping to either publicly release it as a campaign setting for others to use in the future, or use it as a setting for a story-focused game project in the future.</p>
